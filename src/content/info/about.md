## Overview

Hi there! I'm Rosie, but I go by Star online. I'm a professional frontend
web developer, and Discord bot developer, but work on a load of open source stuff outside of work.

Most of my free time is spent programming, mostly on my various open source
projects but also on some closed source projects of my own/for communities I'm a
part of. Besides programming, I also enjoy video games of a wide variety, as
well as dabble in music production and various other hobbies such as mechanical
keyboards. <!-- and 3d printing (soon I hope!) -->

**You may not contact me about anything cryptocurrency/"Web3"/NFT/AI related.**

## Some fun facts about me!

- All my programming knowledge is fully self taught - I picked it up during high
  school as a hobby.

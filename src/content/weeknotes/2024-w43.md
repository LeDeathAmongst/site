I picked up a new case for my PC this week! I've had my eye on the white variant
of the
[Fractal North](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/north/north/chalk-white/)
for a long while, and after getting a little bit of extra money earlier in the
week I decided to finally pick it up. I got the XL variant due to buying the
Radeon 7900 XT a few months ago, which is a _huge_ graphics card, so giving me
the extra space to work with was nice. It was super easy to build in, and I love
the way it looks. Very happy with it!

I finally got over my cold from last week, and I'm feeling a lot better now.
Went out to get my yearly eye test at the optometrist and happy to report that
I've not changed since last year.

Did a little bit of weeding at the garden, just keeping on top of stuff there.
The peas seem to pretty much be finished now, so I think next week I'll cut them
off above the ground. My mum also found a rhubarb in a pot randomly, so I
transplanted that into the garden next to a small strawberry plant that was
already there, so hopefully that'll turn out nice soon.

This week's song is
[Virtual Riot - Scorched Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qiGSWEbOQ)!

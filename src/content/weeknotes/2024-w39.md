Hello world!

A more low-key week after all the bustling of moving house last week. All the
major unpacking has been done, it's just trying to find spots for all the
smaller things now. Going to hit up IKEA sometime soon to get some shelving for
things to make it easier.

In other news, the peas in my garden have started growing pods! Can't wait to
get enough from them to use them in dishes properly.

The place I've moved to also has some garden space (I've been doing gardening at
my parent's place since I lived in an apartment before), and I might start
growing some herbs locally to use them fresh.

I ended up shifting my keyboard layout away from home-row modifiers as I found
myself hitting them on accident too frequently. I tried out auto shift for a few
days and I actually quite enjoyed it, but found out I can't enable it per-layer
in ZSA's online configurator (as otherwise it would screw up with trying to use
my keyboard in games), so for now I've gone back to a standalone shift key on my
left thumb and that's been working well. The other modifiers are kept as
one-shot modifiers on a secondary layer and that's been good for me too.

And today, I baked a cake with my housemates. An orange & poppyseed cake mix
from Green's. Not the fanciest thing, but it came out real nice, just something
to do together on their day off.

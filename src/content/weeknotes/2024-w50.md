Hello world!

Quite a late weeknote this time around; had a very busy day yesterday (Sunday)
helping out my local church with an annual community event. Was out in the sun
pretty much all morning & evening (i remembered to apply sunscreen at least!)
running the sound system for it. I had a lot of fun helping out, but I was quite
exhausted at the end of the day and had to cook dinner as well, so made the
decision to delay writing this entry.

The weather last week was sunny but not too bad in terms of temperature, so I
was able to do more gardening. It was the typical weeding as usual (I didn't get
any more seedlings during the week, although I reckon I should have), but I also
had to re-stake the tomato plants as they've been growing all over the place
like crazy, and one stake wasn't enough for them! They've also started fruiting,
so I'll have some more home-grown tomatoes very soon. Hopefully all the larger
tomatoes don't get eaten by bugs like last time around!

I also picked one of the lettuces that have gotten quite big, going to try it
out this week.

This week's song was

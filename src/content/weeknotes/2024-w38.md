Hello world!

It's been a hell of a week; I moved house! Still unpacking and organising all
the stuff out, but everything has been moved over to the new house, and the old
place has had a thorough cleaning. The new place is nice and big, has a really
nice kitchen (albeit no dishwasher, but we can live with that), and is actually
at ground level so bringing things in and out isn't a huge pain in the ass!

Before the move, I got new switches for my keyboard! I'm now rocking the
**Sunset Tactile** switches on my **Voyager** and it's feeling and sounding
great. Very happy with them. I'm still fiddling with my layout on the keyboard,
not sure if home-row mods are quite the thing for me, going to see what other
people have done on their own keyboards and try to find something that could
work better for me.

During all the unpacking I've started watching **Dimension 20: Never Stop
Blowing Up**, as I've run out of other things that seem interesting (at the
moment), and it's been awesome. I love how they're taking the cheesy 80's action
movie setting in stride and just going with the crazy shit that's happening.
Highly recommend if you're into TTRPG's of any kind!

Despite all the busyness this week, I was able to check out Veela's new song
with Ã˜neheart and TWISTED,
[chrysalis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihpBIMEfU6A). The vibes on the
"music video" are really great so I recommend giving that a look.

Until next time.

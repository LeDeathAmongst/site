subtitle: PAX Australia 2024
---

I've had one hell of a weekend this week; I went to PAX Australia for the first
time! I found myself gravitating towards a bunch of the TTRPG/D&D related panels
thanks to Dimension 20 giving me an itch for the scene. Bought my first sets of
dice in a bundle while I was there, hoping to set up a few one-shots or
campaigns with friends sometime soon.

Not much else to report on this week as I've spent most of the week up in
Melbourne and been physically busy with PAX. I have done a lot of walking due to
the event, so hopefully I'm able to take that back home and build it into a
proper habit again.

This week's song is
[Approaching Black - Don't Look Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5e-q8_QTjs).

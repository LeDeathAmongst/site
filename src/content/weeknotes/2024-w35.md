Hello world!

I decided to start a new Obsidian vault today. I've found myself having a bit of
a crisis with my ADHD and finding myself unable to effectively navigate my
previous setup as it ended up being rather complex and a bit bloated. Hopefully
I'm able to find a way to utilise Obsidian in a way that works properly with my
brain.

I've kept up with my walking this week, and there's been a bit of a change! Two
weeks in a row where I've gone down ~0.5 kg from the previous, so it's
definitely helping out! Very happy with the progress ðŸ™‚.

I've also kept up with the iOS development course I picked up
[last week](/weeknotes/2024-w24). Not much else to report apart from being
halfway through now, but it's been a very good time!

Yesterday I was able to harvest one of the bok choy I planted some time ago, and
used it in a stir-fry for dinner tonight! Came out really really nice; I'm
proud.

Lastly, this week's song is

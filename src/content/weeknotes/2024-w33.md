Hello world!

I kept up my regular walking this week, thanks to a continuation of the great
weather from last week. It's been a real positive for me every day, and I hope
the weather this coming week will be able to keep it up. If not, I'll need to
find some other way of keeping myself movingâ€¦ I haven't used my Quest in a fair
bit.

I did some gardening again yesterday. I planted some peas and Chinese cabbage (I
forget exactly which type) a few weeks ago, and they've been loving the weather!
I've also got some leeks going (which I need to spread out) and some shallots,
but those aren't as far along.

I got _really_ into
[No Man's Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/) this
week, delving deep into their "Liquidators" community expedition and completing
it. I had a lot of fun with it, being more combat focused than I'm used to from
the game! I also started
[Death Stranding](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/)
up, which I've been meaning to for a while. It's been fun too so far.

Lastly, this week's song is
[Bad Computer & imallryt - So Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9qcqtsuh60).

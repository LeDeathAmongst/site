subtitle: The (World of) War(craft) on My Sleep
---

Hello world, happy December!

World of Warcraft really fucked with my sleep schedule this week. It's been
extremely shitty, as a result of my brain _latching_ onto something within and
making it hard to quit. Thankfully it hasn't been interrupting my work, but I
need to be more diligent about going to bed at a reasonable time as the
following mornings have been _rough_.

It was a mixture of rainy, hot, and generally humid all this week, so
unfortunately was not able to find the opportunity to go on any walks (I should
probably look into picking up VR again so I can do some form of exercise at
least), but it did let up during the day today, so I was able to get some much
needed gardening done: cleaning up the weeds that sprung up over the past few
weeks of no gardening, and picking some of the leeks that started budding, which
is actually a lot so I'm going to need to find a good use for them at some
point. Thankfully, looks like there's going to be a nice clear spot in the
middle of the coming week so I'll be able to get some more gardening done - and
even get some more stuff planted - even if the weekend turns out a bit sour.

My obsession this past week has been
[Kooma, Miyoki, Veela - Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llVXSV_Slk0).
Been listening to it a ton while playing WoW, and YouTube keeps serving it back
up to me, not that I'm complaining.

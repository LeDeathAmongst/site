Hello world!

Not much of significance to report on this week. It felt like it whizzed by
super fast and I didn't have the time to really do things. Plus the weather has
started getting stupid (hot one day and raining the next) so I wasn't able to
get outside to do any walks, and it looks like that's going to be the case for
this coming week as well üôÅ.

I did however, play through Half-Life 2 again, thanks to the recent 20th
anniversary update it got. They added a retrospective developer commentary mode
throughout the game, and it was cool listening to them talk about how features
evolved, and how they were seen back in 2004. I'm also going through aiming to
get all the achievements that I never got around to after all these years.

And my housemates dragged me into playing World of Warcraft Classic, with it
also being WoW's 20th anniversary they've launched another branch that is
starting from the vanilla game, like they did originally 5 years ago. Currently
I'm a bit on the fence about it, I'm not really into grindy games, but probably
will stick with it for the 1 month that I bought and then see how I feel about
it then.

This week's song is
[Braxton & Lauren L'aimant - Holding On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjTy-Y__bxA).
